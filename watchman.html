        <p>Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him
            his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb
            up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb
            takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods
            at him. He nods back. Then moves off...
            As <span style="color: #050828; font-weight: 900">Cobb</span> passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle
            greetings with Eames and Yusuf.
            Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who
            glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,
            then moves on...145.
            As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots
            Professor Miles, waving at him...
            INT. KITCHEN, <span style="color: #050828; font-weight: 900">Cobb</span> AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY
            Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,
            looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his
            pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
            table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look upThrough the window, James and Philippa have run into
            view,
            playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
            of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
            KNOCKS on the glassJames and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the
            window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run
            towards him...
            Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. </p>
